  'greeting': 'Welcome to the portfolio website of David Chiu.\n\nMy name is Metallic Dave, a clone of my master David Chiu. David is super lazy, that\'s why he created me to help introduce himself to others. Wanna know more? I can tell you about my technical skills, previous working experience, side projects, hobbies, music I like...etc. I know him so well, because I\'m a clone of him : )  (Sounds philosophical?)\n\nOf course if you prefer to talk with David directly, you can drop him a line at (whatdoyou@ttth.ink)',
  'failedTooManyTimes': 'I am sorry, it seems I am not smart enough to answer your questions, you can try to ask me questions like my previous working experience, technical skills, side projects, hobbies, music I like ...etc\n\nIf I still cannot answer you, maybe you can checkout David\'s static site (http://about.davidchiu.io) Or, shoot him an email at (whatdoyou@ttth.ink)',
  'fallbackMessage': 'Sorry, I didn\'t get that.',
  'serverError': 'It seems there are some problems with the server and I am an online bot living on the internet... you know what I mean...'
